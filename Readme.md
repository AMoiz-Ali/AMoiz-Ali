👋 Hi, I’m @AMoiz-Ali

👀 I’m interested in building scalable web and mobile applications using cutting-edge technologies like React, PHP (Laravel), Node.js, Angular, Vue and Python Django.

🌱 I’m currently learning DevOps best practices, cloud architecture, and AI-powered solutions to streamline development workflows.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative full-stack projects, particularly in the SaaS, security, and workforce management spaces.

⚡ Fun fact: I once built a mobile app for security guards that helped improve job management by 40%!
